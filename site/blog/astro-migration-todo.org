#+title: Astro Migration Todo
#+filetags: :meta:

The site works and is in use. It’s looking better and is on a good track. I’ve just recently gotten some kinks out of the Obsidian post creation process. Here is a todo list of what I want to get done still:

- [ ] Do something with the callouts
- [ ] Pull footnotes to the side when screen size allows
- [x] Get a better `<img>` setup, images currently are far too large
- [x] figure out a way to load markdown files as MDX in Astro[fn:1]
- [ ] Figure out a changelog[fn:2]
- [x] header
- [x] backlinks
- [ ] books page
- [ ] recipes page
- [x] nicer footer
- [x] fonts
- [ ] add desired portions of TufteCSS[fn:3]
- [x] dedicated homepage

This isn’t everything the site needs and this isn’t meant to be comprehensive -- although maybe I should create a site page just for todos and a history of to-dones… Anywho, this page will be updated as things are done and new things are added

[fn:1]: This also might mean “figure out what Astro is flipping out at MDX frontmatter”. I tried this approach using GH actions to rename the files, but that just resulted in errors because of my frontmatter -- despite the docs saying Astro supports MDX frontmatter
[fn:2]: This would be similar to what Evan Travers is [[https://evantravers.com/articles/2019/11/08/using-git-to-generate-a-changelog-for-your-blog/|doing on this site]]. I asked Evan about his changelog and he said he’s updated and is just shelling out and that he mentioned it in [[https://evantravers.com/articles/2022/06/17/extending-redcarpet-for-admonition-blocks/#git-changelog|this post]].
