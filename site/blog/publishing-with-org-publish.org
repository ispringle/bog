#+title: Publishing with org-publish
#+filetags: :meta:emacs:orgmode:

While looking further into ox-hugo I decided to also look further into just
bog-standard org-publish. I already had some elisp to build out my org files to
html and I decided to break that elisp down into a literate program that is then
compiled into a build directory which contains all the shell, elisp, CSS, and
Dockerfiles I need to build and deploy a website built with org-publish. I am
not /currently/ using this to deploy this or any other website, but I was pretty
happy with the result and wanted to share. I think I could quickly get a website
that is almost identical to my current NextJS site.

You can check out [[../build.org][the build script]] and see how I'm doing it.
