#+title: Tangle All The Things
#+filetags: :meta:orgmode:tangle:

So I had this idea last night, and like with all great ideas I googled it see if
anyone else had come up with it first. To my dismay, I was far from the first
person to have this awesome idea. The idea? Literate dotfiles!

Imagine how great it'd be! You write a single file, let's call it ~dotfiles.org~
and then inside of that you write all your dotfiles and document them. Then you
just use org's tangle feature to pull all the config code and stick it into all
the right files in all the right directories. I think I will try this first with
a ZSH config, since I'm getting really annoyed with Fish in emacs and Fish
inside of vterm inside of emacs seems sort of overkill.
