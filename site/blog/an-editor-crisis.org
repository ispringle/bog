* And Editor Crisis
I'm having something of an editor crisis. I want to use emacs (or neovim, that'd
be good too) but because I use the Lit Framework at work, I find I must really
lean on VSCode. The issue is that Lit, besides being a horrible name for search
purposes, uses JS template literal strings for elements and this is a bit messy
when it comes to parsing the buffer. I've debated various solutions, and I think
I might try the option of "no syntax highlighting, no auto-formatting, no
completion". It's how I use to roll. I can do it. We'll see.
