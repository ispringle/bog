#+title: Emacs From Scratch, Part 0
#+filetags: :emacs:

My experience with Emacs can be split into two parts:
1. Emacs with doom
2. Realizing Doom didn't load and quitting Emacs as quickly as possible and
   trying to figure out how to get back into Doom

I have been experiencing some annoyances with emacs lately. It hangs or lags or
chokes on large files (over 1000 lines) and it crashes sometimes. Partly out of
a desire to strip back and get a leaner emacs, and partly out of a desire to
really "try" emacs without the help of someone else's config, I am going to
attempt to build my own emacs from scratch. Of course it'll be /comfy/ in honor of
=comfy.vim=, =comfy.nvim=, and =comfy.tmux=. I'll keep you posted, likely you'll start
seeing something pop up in the [[/literate]] index before you hear from me about it.
