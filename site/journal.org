Trying the idea of being more "org" like and using a single file. I really like the idea of just being able to not worry about structure at all and who knows maybe this is part of that?

Working on org export still, don't like ox-hugo much

Got staging-varnish's varnish service up by manually fixing the shell-in-a-box
stuff in ~default.vcl~. The ansible playbook will have to be updated eventually,
but it should be enough for the time being. Next step is to get the LB up and
pointed at varnish.

Spent my morning playing with org config a little and got a better timestamp
update setup that won't nuke the drawer if it's closed.

Been trying to keep up on clocking today so I can see a nice output of my clock at EOD.

I am unsure if I like that org capture goes to an inbox. It seems pointless since just have to go to the inbox and refile. Might be more useful if I was capturing more often?

Bernice gave birth this morning. I went out around 5am and she had already calved. I went out an hour or two later and brought them into the yard and she'd delivered the placenta by then. Probably would have seen her give birth if I'd went out a half hour earlier.
