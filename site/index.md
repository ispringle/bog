## Welcome to my world

This is the website of Ian Pringle. I am a particular Baptist living in the
sticks of Missouri with my gracious wife and four feral children. I am a
software developer by trade, currently working with web-components and
vanillaJS. Outside of my 9-to-5, I am a tinkerer, farmer, mechanic, builder, and
cowboy.

Here you can find a list of my "posts". For me a "post" is some form of
[prose](/prose.md) which is written at a specfic point in time and likely
remains unchanged after being published. Some changes might occur to correct
issues like grammer, spelling, links, etc., etc. however a post will largely
remain unchanged after being published. Posts will generally be set in a moment
in time, such as "I did or thought this thing". You can think of "posts" as
being akin to a "blog", except I just dislike the word "blog" and want this
website to be more than just "another blog".
