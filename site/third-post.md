# Third Post

This is the third post. It was written <post-date datetime="1970-01-02">shortly after the second one</post-date>.
Its title is not very imaginative: <post-title>My second post</post-title>. The only interesting thing about it
is that the metadata is embedded in the post body rather than written before any real content.
