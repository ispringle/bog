<p>I am Ian Pringle â€“ a sinner saved by grace, a husband and father. I
trade in software development and systems engineering. I am also
attempting something that is a mix of homesteading and building a
self-reliant community, and serving others through the land I have been
blessed by God with.</p>
<p>You can find my latest <a href="./blog/">blog posts here</a>. I have
a "digital garden" that I call "<a href="./grok/grok.org">grok</a>"
which might be of interest to some people. I'm also trying to <a
href="./book">review books</a> (I'm failing at this) that I read, just
to sort of keep a record of what I'm reading and anything I thought
about the book after finishing it. Finally, I have a collection of other
pages and articles <a href="all.org">here</a>.</p>
