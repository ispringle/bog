I am Ian Pringle -- a sinner saved by grace, a husband and father. I
trade in software development and systems engineering. I am also attempting
something that is a mix of homesteading and building a self-reliant community,
and serving others through the land I have been blessed by God with.

You can find my latest [[./blog/][blog posts here]]. I have a "digital garden" that I call
"[[./grok/grok.org][grok]]" which might be of interest to some people.  I'm also trying to [[./book][review
books]] (I'm failing at this) that I read, just to sort of keep a record of what
I'm reading and anything I thought about the book after finishing it. Finally, I
have a collection of other pages and articles [[file:all.org][here]].
