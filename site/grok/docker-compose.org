#+TITLE: Docker Compose

** Running docker-compose in org-mode
First, you need to provide some yaml support for Babel:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-babel-execute:yaml (body params) body)
#+end_src

Then it's just a matter of defining a ~docker-compose.yml~ file:
#+NAME: docker-compose.yml
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :cache yes :dir (getenv "TMPDIR") :file docker-compose.yml :results file
version: '3'
services:
  mineswept:
    image: pard68/mineswept
    ports: ["80:80"]
#+END_SRC

And then run it!
#+begin_src sh :dir (getenv "TMPDIR") :async :results silent
docker-compose up -d
#+end_src

*** Notes
Defining the ~docker-compose.yml~ file does take a little work. You'll need to specify the ~:results~ output to a ~file~ and then name that ~:file~ as ~docker-compose.yml~. We also direct the ~:dir~ to our ~$TMPDIR~, this way we don't pollute our directorites with yaml files. I attempted to set ~:dir~ globally with a ~#+PROPERTY: header-args :dir (getenv "TMPDIR")~ but it didn't work. Might be worth investigating down the road.
