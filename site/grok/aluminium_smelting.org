* Materials
- 1:1 sand and plaster of Paris
- soup can for crucible
- hair dryer for forced positive air
- sand for footing


  Ended up going with a $30 crucible as some accounts state that steel soup-can
  crucibles can fail over time and the bottom will give out when lifting them.
  You want to put the foundry over sand, as if you put it on dirt or concrete
  and the metal accidentally falls onto the ground it can cause an explosion
  from the rapid heating of water in the ground.
