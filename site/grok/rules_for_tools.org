* Rules For Tools
** Time Saver
A tool that takes more time to learn/setup/use is not a good tool
** Good Enough
There's no point in selecting a tool that has features you'll never need. A tool should meet your requirements, exceeding isn't important
** Don't Reinvent The Wheel
If a tool's method of doing a thing isn't to your liking either accept it or find a new tool
