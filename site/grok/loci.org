The concept of /locus/ or /loci/ in Rhetoric (the Greek word /topos/ or /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventio#Topoi][topoi]]/ is also
used interchangeably) is the idea of using categories to highlight relationships
between ideas or arguments. The same Latin and Greek words are also used to
refer to the concept of "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_booBi"k][commonplace books]]" or "commonplaces", which is a
collection of sometimes-related ideas, quotes, letters, poems, and other such
anecdotal datum.
