I'm a sinner saved by grace. I am a husband and father.

By weekday I am a software developer at Jack Henry and Associates. I almost
exclusively work on frontend projects and primarily use the Lit Framework.

My past jobs include working as a systems engineer, a consultant, a full-stack developer
(Openshift, Java, Kotlin, StencilJS), a systems administrator, a helpdesk
agent, and a data-entry monkey. I am a self-taught programmer and systems
operator. I believe this is an immense asset, I am capable to self-directed
learning, often times on the job. I love learning this way and generally try to
take new jobs that will push me into technology I do not already know.
Language-wise I am comfortable working with Lua, Javascript, Python, Rust, Go,
Bash,  PowerShell, and a few Lisps.

I've sort of stumbled and tripped my way into the software world, but after work
and on the weekend I am a neo-Luddite. I work hard to find an appropriate
balance between modern technologies and my God-given desire to work with my
hands.

As you will learn from my projects and blog posts, my interests are many and
varied. I have a degree in New Testament studies, with a minor in Koine Greek --
I love studying and discussing theology. I also like animals, a lot. I live on a
farm in very rural Missouri with my wife and children. We sell raw cow milk, raw
goat milk, and eggs. If you live between Poplar Bluff and West Plains and are
interested in our produce, feel free to reach out!
