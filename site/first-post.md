# First Post

## A wonderful example post

This is the first post. Its first paragraph is displayed on the main page as an excerpt.

Other paragraphs could contain some interesting information. Unfortunately, they don't.

## Another wonderful heading

This is some content under this heading. Isn't it wonderful?

### A great subheading

This is just such a great subheading. I love it!
