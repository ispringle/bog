Sylvan is a work-in-progress, and probably will never be finished. It was my
work towards an ergonomic site-generator for org-mode. I have more or less
abandoned it, as I felt constrained by the Uniorg parser, but more to the point,
I was concerned with the how of converting it from a very specific and custom
site to one that could be used by anyone. I felt like the effort needed to take
the Sylvan project to that point was fairly high, and there already existed a
few better options. Sure, there isn't a nodejs option that is low-friction, but
my project would be better as a template/starter for someone and not as a
framework or platform. So, to the end, I think it has served it's purpose and is
a decent example of how to get a nodejs based, org-mode capable site-generator
up and running.
